# Roblox Version Download

Roblox Version Download is a command-line tool built with a simple batch script that allows you to download roblox assets based on the version number.
Assets are downloaded in the rbxm/rbxl binary format and you will need to open the file in studio to extract the asset as a model.

If you set the output file as an .rbxl file you are able to open in studio easily. The model will be parented to the datamodel.

## Usage

```
rbxverdl [asset id] [version number] [output file]
```

## Compilation Steps

Compilation is not required and the batch script can be ran just like the executable. The executable contains the json script embedded however and if you are using the batch script you will need to have the json script in the same directory.
